# CAMEO (Causal Multi-Environment Optimization)

We propose Cameo, a novel causal transfer-based approach that
allows faster optimization of software systems when the envi-
ronment changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
approach that addresses the performance optimization of the
configurable system using transfer learning.
â€¢ We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Cameo by comparing
it with three state-of-the-art optimization approaches on five
real-world highly configurable systems under a range of different
environmental changes and show the superior performance of CAMEO
